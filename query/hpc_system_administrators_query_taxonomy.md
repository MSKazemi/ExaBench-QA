- Add **AIOps anomaly correlation** queries linking SLURM logs, telemetry, and temperature metrics.  
- Integrate **LLM policy guardrails** for high-risk operations (e.g., reboot, queue control).  
- Create **visual topology mapping** between racks and node pools to enhance facility queries.  
- Expand **energy dashboard integration** for carbon-aware scheduling.
